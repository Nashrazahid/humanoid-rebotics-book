# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Accuracy and correctness**: All technical claims and proposed solutions must be validated against official documentation or reliable sources.
- [ ] **Clarity for beginners**: Plan must prioritize clear, simple, and beginner-friendly language.
- [ ] **Practical guidance**: Plan must include specific, actionable steps and verifiable code examples.
- [ ] **Consistency**: Plan must ensure consistency in terminology, structure, and formatting.
- [ ] **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**: Plan must adhere to SDD principles and integrate with Spec-Kit Plus workflows.
- [ ] **Deployability and Reproducibility**: Plan must ensure the Docusaurus site builds without errors and is deployable to GitHub Pages.
- [ ] **Technical Validation**: All technical design decisions must be backed by validation.
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Plan must incorporate steps to ensure code samples are tested, reproducible, and error-free.
- [ ] **Readability**: Plan structure must facilitate easy reading and comprehension.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
