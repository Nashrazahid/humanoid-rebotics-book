# Book on Humanoid Robotics Constitution

Project: Book on Humanoid Robotics, covering fundamentals, design, kinematics, control systems, sensors, locomotion, and real-world applications.

## Core Principles

- Technical accuracy based on reliable robotics literature
- Clear explanations suitable for beginners and intermediate learners
- Focus on practical understanding and real-world examples
- Consistent terminology throughout the book

## Key Standards

- All technical claims must be validated using reputable robotics sources (research papers, textbooks, official docs)
- Writing style: simple, structured, and beginner-friendly
- Diagrams, examples, and code snippets must be correct and reproducible
- Use clear hierarchy of headings and visuals for readability

## Constraints

- 10–12 chapters
