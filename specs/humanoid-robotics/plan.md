# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Technical Book Creation

**Project**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Technical Book Creation with Docusaurus
**Goal**: Convert high-level business requirements into a structured, technically validated book plan using Spec-Kit-Plus and deployable via Docusaurus to GitHub Pages.

## Architecture Sketch

- Define the full book structure for Docusaurus: Modules → Chapters → Sections → Markdown files.
- Map how theory, simulation tools (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac), and hardware integrate.
- Show flow from Physical AI foundations → simulation → AI models → humanoid deployment.
- Clarify dependencies between modules (Module 1 feeds Module 2 → Module 3 → Module 4).

## Section Structure

- Break each chapter into pedagogical units (Concept → Example → Diagram → Practice).
- Include hardware-practical sections, simulation labs, and real-world deployment steps.
- Include theory, implementation, configuration, and troubleshooting segments.
- Align each section with Docusaurus folder/file structure for seamless navigation.

## Research Approach

- Use research-concurrent flow: gather sources while writing instead of pre-research.
- Pull information from ROS 2 docs, Gazebo/Isaac Sim documentation, robotics papers, NVIDIA resources.
- Cite all claims using APA style (as required by Constitution).
- Validate robotics concepts (kinematics, SLAM, controllers) with authoritative sources.

## Quality Validation

- Ensure explanations match the student audience (AI/robotics learners).
- Include diagrams, block architectures, and flowcharts for complex systems.
- Ensure module transitions follow logical narrative progression.
- Verify that technical instructions (e.g., ROS nodes, VSLAM pipelines) are correct and reproducible.
- Ensure Docusaurus renders correctly (Markdown formatting, navigation, cross-links).
- Final review for clarity, consistency, and factual accuracy.

## Decisions Needing Documentation

- **Book Scope:**
  - Options:
    A. Focus on simulation-only
    B. Include both simulation + physical hardware
  - Tradeoff:
    ↑ Completeness vs ↑ student hardware burden
  - Decision: Cover both simulation + optional physical deployment.

- **Toolchain Focus:**
  - Options:
    A. ROS 2 + Gazebo
    B. ROS 2 + Isaac Sim
    C. Hybrid
  - Tradeoff:
    Gazebo → easier; Isaac → more realistic but GPU-heavy
  - Decision: Hybrid (as required by business requirements).

- **VLA Integration:**
  - Options:
    A. High-level GPT reasoning only
    B. Full VLA: vision + language + action mapping
  - Tradeoff:
    Simplicity vs Realism
  - Decision: Full VLA pipeline demonstration in Module 4.

- **Deployment Path:**
  - Options:
    A. On-Premise RTX Workstations
    B. Cloud-native Omniverse
  - Tradeoff:
    Hardware cost vs cloud cost + latency
  - Decision: Mention both paths with caveats.

## Testing Strategy

- **Validation against Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All modules match the course’s weekly breakdown.
  - All technical claims are source-verified (APA style).
  - Simulation labs must run end-to-end on supported hardware.
  - **Pilots:**
    - ROS node should build + run
    - Gazebo simulation must spawn humanoid
    - Isaac Sim environment must load without GPU errors
    - VLA demo should parse a natural-language command → planned ROS 2 actions
  - Conceptual correctness check by comparing with robotics literature.
  - **Structural checks:**
    - Each chapter includes outcomes, examples, diagrams, and exercises.
    - Module progression must support capstone integration.
    - Docusaurus navigation, sidebar, and cross-links verified.

## Technical Details

- **Research Style:**
  - Use research-concurrent workflow (research while writing).
- **Citation Standard:**
  - Follow APA style citations (per Constitution).
- **Organization Style:**
  - Organize content in workflow phases:
    1. Research (sources, examples, diagrams)
    2. Foundation (explanations + conceptual clarity)
    3. Analysis (toolchain specifics, algorithms, code, architecture)
    4. Synthesis (integrating theory + practice into labs and capstone)
- **Docusaurus Integration:**
  - Ensure content folders, Markdown files, sidebars, and cross-links follow Docusaurus conventions.
  - Include docs, code snippets, images, and interactive links.
- **GitHub Deployment:**
  - Create GitHub repository for the book.
  - Configure `docusaurus.config.js` with correct `url` and `baseUrl`.
  - Install `gh-pages` package and add deploy scripts in `package.json`.
  - Build site using `npm run build` and deploy using `npm run deploy`.
  - Verify site live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
  - Include notes on deployment paths: local vs cloud hosting considerations.

## Output Format:

- Provide the complete plan with:
  - Architecture
  - Chapter-by-chapter section outline
  - Technical considerations
  - Validation + testing methods
  - Documented decisions
  - Ready-to-deploy Docusaurus book structure on GitHub Pages
